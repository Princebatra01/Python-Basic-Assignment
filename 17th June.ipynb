    "Ans: A bare except block, without specifying any exception type, will catch and handle any exception that occurs inside the try block. It acts as a catch-all for any type of exception. While it can be convenient to catch all exceptions, it can also make it difficult to diagnose and handle specific errors because the code inside the except block will execute regardless of the exception type. It can lead to unintentionally catching and handling exceptions that should be handled differently.\n",
    "On the other hand, Specifying a specific exception type in an except block allows you to catch and handle only that particular type of exception. It provides more control over error handling because you can write specific code to handle different types of exceptions differently.\n"
