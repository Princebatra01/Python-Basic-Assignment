    "2. What is the difference between string and variable?\n",
    "String is a constant i.e., it can only hold information of data type string\n",
    "Whereas variable can hold any type of information depending upon the conditions the value can be changed.\n",
    "String is a type of information that can be stored in a variable.\n",

    "3. Describe three different data types.\n",
    "String: represents text/alphabets\n",

    "5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?\n",
    "Expressions are evaluated to produce/generate some results while statements are not evaluated for some results, statements can be used to change the state of the variable like if spam = 10 then spam is an integer variable but if spam = “SPAM” then spam is a string variable\n",

    "100 is an invalid variable because as per Python variable Rules A variable name cannot start with a number.\n",
